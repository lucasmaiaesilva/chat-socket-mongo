## Get Started

* Install MongoDB globally on you computer
* run `> mongod --master` on your terminal
* Open the folder of the project on your terminal as well
* run '> npm install' (maybe you have to use sudo)

And the magic is happening

Access 'http://localhost:8080' on your browser and enjoy ;)
